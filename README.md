# Project

Background: 

    It is a simple game of shooting a basketball through the basket called Messenger Basketball. The ball starts at different horizontal places and the basket changes position or moves as the user levels up. A miss ends the game, and the user has to start over. 



Functionality & MVPs:

    In Messenger Basketball, users will be able to:

        Starts, pauses, and restarts when the user loses
        Throws balls to the basket
        Can aim in different horizontal directions

    In addition, this project will include:

        An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
        A production README


Technologies, Libraries, APIs:

    This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

        The Canvas API for animating and writing codes
        The MelonJS or PhysicsJS for physics and collisions
        The ImpactJS for 3D effects


Implementation Timeline: 

    By Monday, initial setup of the game needs to be ready. The setup includes the html and canvas part
    where my ball and hoop and the surrounding appear.

    By Tuesday and halfway through Tuesday, have the game setup where the hoop starts to move and how the ball needs to go through the
    hoop to get points. This includes PhysicsJS and ImpactJS libraries will be placed by then.

    By Wednesday, finish up the project by implementing levels as user reaches a certain score and making
    the game harder and putting a max score. 

    By Thursday and last day, work on styling and presentation and any minor errors
